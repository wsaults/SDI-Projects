<p>This story is about a student's first day in class. This isn't an exhaustive rendition of meeting students, doing schoolwork, or meeting teachers. This short story is about showing up and briefly saying a few things to the teacher and being dismissed to enjoy the rest of the day without class. Short and sweet.
