<p>I chose to write about my vacation because it is unique to me and fresh on my mind.</p>
<p>This story is an elaborate retelling of the first half of my first day of vacation.
The elements in my story are clear and easy to relate to. Therefore they don't need any explanation other than what is actually in the story.</p>
